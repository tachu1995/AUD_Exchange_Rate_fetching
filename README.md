# Currency Exchange Rate Logger

This script fetches currency exchange rates from multiple APIs and logs the data into a Google Sheet. It retrieves rates and updates the Google Sheet with the latest values. The script uses the requests library to make HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, and the Google Sheets API for data entry.
